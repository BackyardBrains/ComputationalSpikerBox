### Computational Spiker Box
The Computational Spiker Box ( hereafter called CSBox ) is a hardware lab meant to explore better the interactions between the senses and the central nervous system. This device was developed by Backyard Brains engineers, and the focus is on a student’s neuroscience education. The CSBox works by taking established neuron mathematical models and allowing the user to interact with them via hardware ( in our case, potentiometers or "knobs" and sensors).
	The immediate thought is for a teacher to get the CSBox, run through the testing stage on their device, and then get their students involved by making their models and testing each model on their main computer.
Should the teacher want to, this could also be run where they buy a CSBox for each student, opening up possibilities to explore more of the computational neuroscience side as students can pull apart the models for Morris Lecar and Isheveich, and potentially even dive into some of the machine learning/sensors if the class is more of a STEM fusion. It depends on the environment and the target audience ( each student owning a CSBox might be more of a private school thing depending on price ).
