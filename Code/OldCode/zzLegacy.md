## For the sake of posterity

I have had the pleasure of working on this project since October 2024 ( My oldest modification / last touch on a file was 12/6/2024 )

Thse are all key files that tell this progrmaming journy, from pure Izhk up an running, switching from Arduino Nano to the ESP32S3 Dev Swroom2 board, messing around with morris lecar ( which was actually meant to be hodgkin and huxley ), the deep dive into machine learning, and the current approach with 3 sensors, 5 outputs, and a guessing game
